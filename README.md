> This library provides an easy-to-use integration between the Laravel framework and the Contentful Delivery SDK. It requires PHP 8.0 and up.

## Setup

Add this package to your application by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and executing the following command:

``` bash
composer require contentful/laravel
```

Add the service provider to the `providers` array in `config/app.php`:

``` php
'providers' => [
    Contentful\Laravel\ContentfulServiceProvider::class,
],
```

## Configuration

Publish the config file:

``` sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Contentful\Laravel\ContentfulServiceProvider"
```

This will add `contentful.php` to your `/config` folder. Next, add your space ID and API key to your `.env` file:

    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID="cfexampleapi"
    CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN="b4c0n73n7fu1"

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.
